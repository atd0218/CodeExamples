## Objective

__Part 1:__ Create a class named Ramen. Data fields include a String for the protein ingredient (such as egg), a String for ramen type (such as Tonkotsu), and a double for price (such as 11.99). Include methods to get and set values for each of these fields. Save the class as Ramen.java. 

_Hint_: Use class Scanner to prompt user's input
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
...
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
...
System.out.println("Enter the protein ingredient >> ");
ingredient = input.nextLine();

```

__Part 2:__ Create an application named OrderRamen that prompts the user for data, instantiates one Ramen object, and displays its values. Save the application as OrderRamen.java.
